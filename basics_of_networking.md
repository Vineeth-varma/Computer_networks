## Network Fundamentals
**Socket** -> The combination of IP and Port together called Socket.

**nslookup www.goolge.com**   -> To check the IP adress of the dns server.

**netstat -a**   -> To check the used port numbers.

**ipconfig**  -> To get the IP adress   -> Unique adress to identify a host.

**ipconfig/all**  -> To get the mac adress  -> MAC Address is the unique identifier of each host and is associated with its NIC (Network Interface Card). A MAC address is assigned to the NIC at the time of manufacturing. 

**IP adress** -> 32 bits (ipv4) , 128 bits (ipv6)  -> means we can have 2^32 ip adresses.

**Port**  -> 16 bits -> 2^16  ports available.

**Mac adresses** -> 12-nibble/ 6 bytes/ 48 bits.

**ARP** -> Adress Resolution Protocol -> It is used to convert an IP address to its corresponding physical address(i.e., MAC Address). ARP is used by the Data Link Layer to identify the MAC address of the Receiver’s machine. 

* Computer Network means an interconnection of autonomous (standalone) computers for information exchange. The connecting media could be a copper wire, optical fiber, microwave, or satellite. 
* **Network Criteria:**
  *  **Performance** -  It is measured in terms of transit time and response time.
  *  **Reliability** - It is measured in terms of Frequency of failure, Recovery from failures, Robustness during catastrophe.
  *   **Security** – It means protecting data from unauthorized access. 

## Types of Network Topology
* The arrangement of a network that comprises nodes and connecting lines via sender and receiver is referred to as network topology.
* **Mesh Topology :** - In a mesh topology, every device is connected to another device via a particular channel.

* **Star Topology :** - In star topology, all the devices are connected to a single hub through a cable.

* **Bus Topology :** - Bus topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to a single cable.

* **Ring Topology** - In this topology, it forms a ring connecting devices with its exactly two neighboring devices.

* **Tree Topology** - This topology is the variation of Star topology. This topology has a hierarchical flow of data.

## Types of Area Networks
* k allows computers to connect and communicate with different computers via any medium. LAN, MAN, and WAN are the three major types of networks designed to operate over the area they cover. There are some similarities and dissimilarities between them. One of the major differences is the geographical area they cover, i.e. LAN covers the smallest area; MAN covers an area larger than LAN and WAN comprises the largest of all. 
There are other types of Computer Networks also, like : 
 

PAN (Personal Area Network)
SAN (Storage Area Network)
EPN (Enterprise Private Network)
VPN (Virtual Private Network)
